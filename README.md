# capicxx-wamp-tools [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GENIVI/capicxx-wamp-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GENIVI/capicxx-wamp-tools)
Common API tooling with WAMP messaging.

## Roadmap

This is work in progress, we plan to provide initial releases later this year (2017).

The binding code generator from this project will create C++ code which needs a proper runtime library.
One can find the runtime library in the companion project https://github.com/GENIVI/capicxx-wamp-runtime.
